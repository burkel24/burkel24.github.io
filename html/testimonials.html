											<p class="testimonial">We needed a guy who understood the big picture — the appropriate beginning, middle and end for our production. John Mazzocco
												listened carefully to our plan, made smart suggestions, and then put his production experience and professional network into
												action. The result was an unforgettable evening of perfectly timed dining, speeches, fundraising and entertainment that struck
												the right beats at the right moments. </br></br>Plan the work – work the plan, but also be clever and confidant enough to improvise
												and take chances when necessary. That’s John Mazzocco.</p>

											<p class="testimonial">It is with confidence that we introduce Bluedot Communications and their presentation training services. They have been
												involved in numerous training sessions with us over the past three years and their track record in that regard is outstanding.</br></br>
												Bluedot has proved their worth on every occasion and boasts a remarkable 85% success rate in the jobs that we have used them
												for. Concentrating on character as well as content has allowed them to carve their own niche in the presentation industry,
												raising our own skills in the process. Intricate large public projects seem to be their sweet spot. Complete background research
												on the review panels and delivery of that to the presenting process has allowed us to concentrate on our ability to deliver
												with confidence. </br></br>I am sure that they can help your firm in the delivery and completion of your next large project. Please
												don’t hesitate to call if you have questions about our work together.</p>

											<p class="testimonial">It was great to meet you and to have the opportunity to benefit from your abundant experience and insight regarding our
												team’s presentation to the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium. </br></br>As you know, our team was successful in our effort to secure this
												very important project, and while collectively have a lot of talent as presenters, we certainly benefited a great deal from
												your coaching. We owe you a lot of credit for our successful outcome. I’ve been making design presentations now for over
												30 years. Over that time, worked with a lot of very good presenters, and have also attended several workshops tailored to
												the design industry for the purposes of improving presentations to clients and colleagues. I can say that I learned a great
												deal in the short time we spent together, and probably more than from all the other workshops combined. </br></br>Your knowledge, insight,
												objectivity, and candor combined with wit and humor made for an exciting and effective process and outcome. Your passion
												for your work is evident and infectious, and for all these reasons, I whole-heartedly recommend you and the services of Bluedot
												to others. I look forward to more opportunities to work with you, and I’m happy that we were able to not only win this commission,
												but contribute to your already strong record for success!</p>
